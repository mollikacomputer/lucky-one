            React is Javascript library. Its work one dimenson way top to bottom like as water fall. 
            react devided part by part all website like as every deferrent part. If have same things need many time to use then react make component small part of website. When we find similar in look deferrent in data then we react make a component and passing data into props. props is data passing system component to another component. React is function base. React have many built in function thats we use easyli. like useState, useEffect,  useState is a function its use get data and set data, When we want to getData from outside of react then we use useEffect and we can set data and get data with useState; React handle all component is smoothly. when find different data then react update only defferent data. React make a virtual dome specially and when find different data then react match new data and virtual data; React doing cross mass and update only defferent part.
